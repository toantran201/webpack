<!-- WEBPACK
  Webpack takes all of our assets and outputs them to a production-ready bundle
   - Bundles JavaScript files into one file, minimizing http requests
   - Process SASS / LESS files into CSS and only use them where needed
   - Convert JSX or ES2015 into vanilla JS which browsers understand
